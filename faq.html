                      <p>The MHC Actis a law, which provides for mental healthcare and treatment of persons with mental
                        illness. It protects their rights and ensures that such persons are treated with respect and dignity.
                        The MHC Act is inspired by the United Nations Conventions on Rights of Persons with Disabilities
                        [ “UNCRPD”].</p>

                        <p>The UNCRPD is a document of international law. It recognises, protects and promotes the human
                        rights of all persons with disabilities including those who have mental illnesses (psychosocial
                        disabilities). It lists down all the rights of persons with disabilities and the manner in which persons
                        with disabilities should be treated.</p>
                        <p>The MHC Act is a law which lays down the rights, procedures and duties to ensure mental
                        healthcare and treatment of persons with mental illness based on the UNCRPD. The most
                        important aspect of the MHC Act is that it places persons with mental illness at the centre of the
                        mental healthcare system. It recognises the capacity of all persons with mental illness to take
                        decisions regarding their mental healthcare and treatment and ensures that their will and
                        preferences are considered primary in all situations from the time of admission to rehabilitation
                        and recovery after discharge from hospitals.</p>

                      <p>The MHC Actis a law, which protects the rights of persons with mental illness by ensuring a rightsbased approach to mental healthcare and treatment. It lays down the duties of different
                        stakeholders such as mental health professionals, caregivers, law enforcement officials,
                        government officials and others for ensuring mental healthcare and treatment is provided to all
                        persons with mental illness. Being aware of the provisions of the MHC Act is crucial since it has
                        implications for mental health professionals and their clinical practice. Non- compliance with the
                        MHC Act can also result in penal consequences under the MHC Act.</p>
