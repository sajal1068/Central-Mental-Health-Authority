It protects their rights and ensures that such persons are treated with respect and dignity. The MHC Act is inspired by the United Nations Conventions on Rights of Persons with Disabilities [ “UNCRPD”].</p><p>The UNCRPD is a document of international law. It recognises, protects and promotes the human rights of all persons with disabilities including those who have mental illnesses (psychosocial disabilities). It lists down all the rights of persons with disabilities and the manner in which persons with disabilities should be treated.</p><p>The MHC Act is a law which lays down the rights, procedures and duties to ensure mental healthcare and treatment of persons with mental illness based on the UNCRPD. The most important aspect of the MHC Act is that it places persons with mental illness at the centre of the mental healthcare system. It recognises the capacity of all persons with mental illness to take decisions regarding their mental healthcare and treatment and ensures that their will and preferences are considered primary in all situations from the time of admission to rehabilitation and recovery after discharge from hospitals.</p>" },
      { question: "2.  Why is it important for mental health professionals to comply with the MHC Act?", answer: "<p>The MHC Actis a law, which protects the rights of persons with mental illness by ensuring a rightsbased approach to mental healthcare and treatment. It lays down the duties of different stakeholders such as mental health professionals, caregivers, law enforcement officials,government officials and others for ensuring mental healthcare and treatment is provided to all persons with mental illness. Being aware of the provisions of the MHC Act is crucial since it has implications for mental health professionals and their clinical practice. Non- compliance with the MHC Act can also result in penal consequences under the MHC Act</p>" },
      { question: "3. Does the MHC Act provide for socio-economic benefits such as employment, education,housing, etc. for persons with mental illness?", answer: "<p>The MHC Act is concerned with only mental healthcare and treatment of persons with mental illness.

However, if there are reasons to believe that such a person may not have capacity,then the mental health professional must conduct a capacity assessment.</p>" },
      { question: "7. Are there any guidelines to assess whether a person has capacity or not?", answer: "<p>Mental health professionals must assess capacity in accordance with the Capacity Assessment Guidance document prescribed by the Expert Committee appointed by the Central Mental Health Authority according to Section 81 of the MHC Act. This document is available in the Reference Manual for Implementation of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 for Mental Health Professionals (accessible on the CMHA Website). </p>" },
      { question: "8. If a person with mental illness has appointed a nominated representative, does that mean the person has no capacity?", answer: "<p>If a person has appointed a nominated representative to support him/her in making decisions,this does not mean that the person with mental illness does not have capacity to make decisions.A person can exercise capacity with varying levels of support from his/her nominated representative. Similarly, if a person is unable to appoint a nominated representative for any reason, this does not mean that the person lacks capacity.</p>" },
      { question: "9. What is an advance directive?", answer: "<p>There can be a situation in the life of a person with mental illness, where he/she is unable to communicate his/her decisions regarding his/her mental healthcare or treatment. To deal with such a situation a person may plan in advance to ensure that his/her will and preferences are respected.</p><p>He/she can do so by stating his/her choices about treatment (will and preferences) in advance,so that if in the future he/she is unable to make decisions, he/she can be treated in accordance with his/her advance directive.</p><p>Advance planning can be done by writing an advance directive, which is a document in which a person writes about how he/she wishes to be treated for a mental illness in a situation where he/she does not have capacity to make decisions regarding the same.</p><p>An advance directive must specify any or all of the following information:</p><ul class='faqList'><li>The way the person wishes to be cared for and treated for a mental illness;<br><span class='d-block text-center'>Or</span></li><li>The way the person wishes not to be cared for and treated for a mental illness;<br><span class='d-block text-center'>Or</span></li><li>Individual(s) he/she wishes to appoint as a nominated representative, in order of preference.</li></ul>" },
      { question: "10. Who can make an advance directive?", answer: "<p>According to the MHC Act, any person (whether or not he/she has a history of mental illness) has the right to make an advance directive. However, minors cannot make advance directives for themselves</p>" },
      { question: "11. What is the procedure for making an advance directive?", answer: "<p>To create an advance directive, a person must submit a written application to the Mental Health Review Board using Form A, as prescribed by the Central Mental Health Authority’s Regulations, 2020. This Form should be provided free of cost in all mental health establishments. The advance directive must be signed in the presence of two witnesses who confirm that the concerned person has signed the directive. It must then be registered with the Mental Health Review Board in the person’s area. After registration, the advance directive will be made available online within 14 days of the registration.</p>" },
      { question: "12. Can a person change or cancel his/her advance directive?", answer: "<p>A person can modify their advance directive as many times as needed, following the same procedure. The most recent advance directive will override all previous versions. However, a person cannot request a change to their advance directive until at least three months have passed since the previous directive was issued.</p>" },
      { question: "13. What is the duty of the medical personnel with respect to advance directives?", answer: "<p>Once the medical personnel are informed of the advance directive, it is their duty to propose or give treatment to the person in accordance with the valid advance directive.</p>" },
      { question: "14. Can a mental health professional challenge an advance directive?", answer: "<p>A mental health professional can challenge an advance directive if he/she does not wish to follow it for a particular reason. To challenge an advance directive an application will have to be submitted to the concerned Mental Health Review Board. The Board will hear the parties involved and give its decision on whether the advance directive must be altered, modified or cancelled.</p>" },
      { question: "15. If a copy of advance directive is not given to a mental health professional, can he/she be held liable for not following the same? ", answer: "<p>According to Section 13 (1) of the MHC Act, if a copy of a valid advance directive has not been provided to a mental health professional then he/she cannot be held liable for not following the advance directive. However, mental health professionals should refer to the online register of advance directives prepared by the concerned Mental Health Review Board whenever a person with mental illness is admitted in a mental health establishment.</p>" },
      { question: "16. Can a mental health professional be held liable for the consequences of following a valid advance directive?", answer: "<p>No. According to Section 13 (1) of the MHC Act, a mental health professional cannot be held liable for the unforeseen consequences of following a valid advance directive.</p>" },
