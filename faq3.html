                    1. What is the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017?

                      <p>The MHC Actis a law, which provides for mental healthcare and treatment of persons with mental
                        illness. It protects their rights and ensures that such persons are treated with respect and dignity.
                        The MHC Act is inspired by the United Nations Conventions on Rights of Persons with Disabilities
                        [ “UNCRPD”].</p>

                        <p>The UNCRPD is a document of international law. It recognises, protects and promotes the human
                        rights of all persons with disabilities including those who have mental illnesses (psychosocial
                        disabilities). It lists down all the rights of persons with disabilities and the manner in which persons
                        with disabilities should be treated.</p>
                        <p>The MHC Act is a law which lays down the rights, procedures and duties to ensure mental
                        healthcare and treatment of persons with mental illness based on the UNCRPD. The most
                        important aspect of the MHC Act is that it places persons with mental illness at the centre of the
                        mental healthcare system. It recognises the capacity of all persons with mental illness to take
                        decisions regarding their mental healthcare and treatment and ensures that their will and
                        preferences are considered primary in all situations from the time of admission to rehabilitation
                        and recovery after discharge from hospitals.</p>

                      <p>The MHC Actis a law, which protects the rights of persons with mental illness by ensuring a rightsbased approach to mental healthcare and treatment. It lays down the duties of different
                        stakeholders such as mental health professionals, caregivers, law enforcement officials,
                        government officials and others for ensuring mental healthcare and treatment is provided to all
                        persons with mental illness. Being aware of the provisions of the MHC Act is crucial since it has
                        implications for mental health professionals and their clinical practice. Non- compliance with the
                        MHC Act can also result in penal consequences under the MHC Act.</p>

                      A supported admission under Section 89 of the MHC Act is when a person has a severe mental
illness and lacks capacity to take decisions. Such a person can be admitted involuntarily by his/her
nominated representative. Such a person can be admitted only for 30 days. However, continued
supported admission under Section 90 of the MHC Act shall apply if and when such person
requires to be admitted beyond 30 days.

                    <div class="answer">
                     <p> According to Section 97, physical restraint can be used when it is the only means to prevent
                      imminent and immediate harm to the person or to others and it is authorized by the psychiatrist
                      in charge of the person’s treatment at the hospital. It is the duty of the mental health professional
                      or medical officer in charge of the hospital to ensure that the method, nature of restraint,
                      justification for its imposition and the duration of the restraint are recorded in the patient
                      records. The nominated representative must be informed of any restraint within 24 hours, and
                      all instances of restraint must be reported monthly to the concerned Board by the mental health
                      establishment.
